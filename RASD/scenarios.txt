- Scenario 1
	Andrea works in Milan and, both because he really cares about climate issues and to 
	avoid traffic congestions, he usually reach his workplace by bike. Indeed, finding a good spot
	to park his bicycle is not that easy, as there are often many cars parked very close to the bicycle
	parkings where Andrea is used to leave his bike, and he is getting frustrated about this. 
	When he learns about SafeStreets, he decides to immediately download it on his smartphone and to register
	himself, providing his personal informations and his address, with the intention to report each time when
	a car is parked too near a bicycle parking, hoping that he will soon be able to leave his bike safely near
	his workplace.

- Scenario 2
	Unforntunately Luca's brother recently broke his leg during a football match and he will be confined to a 
	wheelchair for a few months. One day, when Luca is taking him to hospital for a routine visit, he notices 
	that the disabled parking where he usually park his car is already busy, so he is forced to look for a parking
	far away from the hospital. When he finally reaches the hospital, he notices that the car is not showing the
	badge that allows it to use that spot so, as he is registered to SafeStreets service, he logs into the application,
	creates a new report, takes a picture of the car's license plate, includes a short description
	of the issue and sends his report to the system. After some days, he logs again into the application to check
	if his signalization was verified or not and acknowledges that a traffic ticket was provided to the owner
	of the car.

- Scenario 3
	Sara would like to join a friend of her for a snack at a well known cafè in their town lately this afternoon,
	and as she has been studying the whole day, she would like to reach the place on foot to stretch her legs and
	relax. But to reach the cafè, she has to cross a road known to be very busy, especially at that time of the day,
	without traffic lights but with a single crosswalk which might be dangerous as well because in the past years 
	she sometimes noticed cars parked on it. Sara has recently registered on SafeStreets and she knows that statistics
	about violations are collected, so she decides to check whether in the last days someone has reported a violation
	of this kind in that street. Gladly, she notices that nobody has parked a car on the crosswalk for a very long period,
	so she will enjoy her walk and her brief moment of freedom.

- Scenario 4
	In the last few months, the citizens of Cologno Monzese have been more and more complaining about the increasing
	traffic violations occurring in the territory of the municipality. At the moment local authorities aren't able to
	displace enough resources to catch most violations, so they decide to provide citizens more responsibility and
	register to the SafeStreets service as Authority. With the help of the citizens and the system, the local police is
	able to displace patrols in the zones where most violations are reported, issuing many more traffic tickets to 
	violators (and managing a pretty good income for the municipality income as well). 
	Soon the authorities, as they note the efficiency of the service, decide that they will exploit the statistics made
	by SafeStreets about the most egregious offenders, and to stimulate citizens to collaborate in reporting the violations
	they will give some kind of reward to those who will send more reports during each year (until no one will make violations
	any more...).

- Scenario 5
	Francesco, a system manager of SafeStreets, is responsible of collecting the incoming reports from the zone near
	Magenta. During the last three months, he started receiving many more reports from citizens as well as information from
	about accidents, sometimes with severely injured people, especially from a main road connecting small town of the zone.
	So, Francesco decides to highlight the road as dangerous to the local authorities, and also suggests to provide patrols or
	checkpoints in order to have a better supervision and prevent more accidents from occurring.
